The topic that our group decided to work on is on plant vs animal diet. The main
objective of this work was to recreate some of the figures in the publication by David,2014.

Our group directly imported all the data sets from online so we don't need to set the
directory and easily reproduce the pipeline. 

Our first code is animal_plant_diet.R is compose of four code chunks as follows:

	1. Data importing (chunk 1) -> mainly loading all the libraries needed to run the
					pipeline and importing the data from online sources.
					
	2. Data processing (chunk 2)-> these chunk include the cleaning of the reads and
					merging the main data and the metadata
					
	3. Alpha diversity (chunk 3)  -> calculating the alpha diversity, plotting it, and 
					exporting the plot in pdf using ggsave
					
	4. Dendogram (chunk 4) -> subsetting the baseline and diet data, calculating Spearman
					correlation, plotting the dendogram and exporting the plot into pdf
					using base R.

#### Data importing #####

# Make sure you all the packages installed for the following libraries

# Libraries
library(tidyverse) # install.packages("tidyverse")--for data wrangling
library(reshape2) # install.packages("reshape2")--to convert data from wide to long format
library(ape) # install.packages("ape") -- to make hierarchal clustering
library(vegan) # install.packages("vegan") -- for making alpha diversity
library(ggplot2) # install.packages("ggplot2") -- to make plots
library(dendextend) # install.pacakges ("dendoextend") --to make dendogram
library(ggpubr) #install.packages ("ggpubr") -- to put together plots in one page

# Import data --> Taxable from Green Genes Database
Taxa <- read.delim("https://knights-lab.github.io/MLRepo/datasets/david/gg/taxatable.txt", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
dim(Taxa) #get the dimension of data
glimpse(Taxa) #glimpse of the data set


# Import original metadata from David 2014
Meta <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knights-lab/MLRepo/master/datasets/david/mapping-orig.txt", header = TRUE)

# Subset only relevant information from the metadata
Meta <-select(Meta, X.SampleID, SubjectFood, Diet, Day)
